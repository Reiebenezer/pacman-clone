# Pac-man Clone
Pac-man Clone is my own take of the well-known and beloved Pac-man, with some behavioral changes that will bring about new dynamics and life to the game.

### New Ghost AI

New algorithms have been created to improve the ghost AI, making it slightly more predictable yet difficult to exploit. For example, Inky will now have the same algorithm as that of Blinky, only with a minor twist to it--Check the game to find out!


### Ghost Abilities

Each of the four ghosts in the maze now have their own unique abilities, each tailored to improve the difficulty of the game. Blinky can now hover much faster for a certain duration, Pinky can now teleport to a random location, Inky can now pass through walls, and Clyde can create a clone of itself. Each ability has a set duration and cooldown.

### New Gamemode: Brutal Survival

Brutal Survival is a new gamemode, where instead of eating pellets, the player (pacman) must endure for as long as possible against the stronger and faster ghost AI, with their ability cooldowns and scatter timers lowered and ability durations increased. The player can eat a power pellet placed randomly on the board, and a new one will spawn when the pellet is eaten. The frightened duration is cut in half in this game mode.
